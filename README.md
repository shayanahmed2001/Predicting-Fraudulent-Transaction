# Predicting-Fraudulent-Transaction
In the initial phase of my project, I focused on data exploration and discovery. I began by identifying outliers within the dataset and subsequently conducted a correlation analysis based on the outliers. During this analysis, I observed that some columns exhibited a correlation of 1, indicating a perfect linear relationship, yet failed to effectively represent the intended underlying information. To address this issue, I performed one-hot encoding on categorical variables, ensuring that the model could comprehend the distinct transactions. Following data preprocessing, I employed two machine learning models, namely Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, to train the data. After fitting the models, I evaluated their performance using accuracy scores. In the final stage, I examined the importance of each feature by extracting feature importances.
